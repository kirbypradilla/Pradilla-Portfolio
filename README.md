Navigation links using <a href="#section"> smoothly jump to corresponding sections like #Profile, #education, etc., allowing users to quickly access different content on the same page.

Project boxes are clickable and open a modal with project details.

The modal is hidden by default and shows content when triggered.

A close button lets users hide the modal.

Clicking outside the modal also closes it automatically.
